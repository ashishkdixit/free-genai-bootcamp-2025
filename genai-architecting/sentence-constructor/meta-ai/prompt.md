    <score_reasons>
        - BAD: In the Vocabulary table it didn't show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
        - BAD: The beginning sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of the verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
        - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work through it together.
        Vocabulary Table

        | Japanese	| Romaji	    | English |
        |           | kuma	        | bear |
        |           | tobira	    | door |
        |           | mimi	        | ear (hear) |
        |           | suteru	    | throw away(leave out) |
        |           | gomi	        | garbage  |
        |           | iru	be      | (at) |
        |           | shimau	    | leave (out) |

        Sentence Structure
        Verb/Adjective + (wa/ga) + Noun + (ni/o) + Verb/Adjective
        Clues
        Start by identifying the main subject of the sentence, "Bears". How would you say "bears" in Japanese?
        Think about how you would express the location "at the door" in Japanese.
        The sentence is asking a question, so consider how you would form a question in Japanese.
        Look at the vocabulary table and find the words for "garbage" and "leave out". How would you use these words in the sentence?
        Work through the sentence using these clues, and I'll be happy to provide more guidance as needed!

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
